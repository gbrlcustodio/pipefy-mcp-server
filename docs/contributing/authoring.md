# Documentation authoring

This guide describes the target structure for the `docs/` tree and where a new doc goes. Its siblings are [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) and [`conventions.md`](conventions.md).

The tree is mid-migration to this target. Where a file still sits in the wrong place, an open issue tracks the move.

## Where a doc goes

Sort by audience first, then by kind.

- Contributor docs live under `docs/contributing/`.
- Consumer docs live by surface under `docs/mcp/`, `docs/cli/`, and `docs/sdk/`.
- A durable, cross-cutting consumer doc lives at the `docs/` root. A fast-changing one is generated instead (see below).

Then keep a doc to one kind where practical. The Diataxis kinds are tutorial, how-to, reference, and explanation. A file that mixes several is a split candidate.

## Decision records

A decision record is contributor explanation of a distinct kind: one architectural decision, immutable once adopted. The set lives under `docs/contributing/adr/`, one file per decision. To change a decision, add a record that supersedes the old one. Do not edit an adopted record. The rule a record produces graduates to `architecture.md` or `conventions.md`, where a contributor reads the current rule. The record keeps the reasoning.

## Generate fast-changing reference from code

A hand-maintained doc that mirrors a code list will drift. Make the code the single source of truth, and generate the doc from it: docstrings, pydantic `Field(description=...)`, the tool registry, or Typer help. Hand-author only where there is no code source, such as a concept doc. Do not keep a generated table and durable prose in the same file.

## Keep it small

Keep recognizable names: `README`, `CHANGELOG`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, `MIGRATION`, `DEPRECATION`, and `ARCHITECTURE` (as `docs/contributing/architecture.md`). A directory earns its keep by file count and homogeneity, so do not invent a `guides/` or `reference/` bucket for a few files. A concrete cleanup or migration step is a closeable task, so open an issue instead of listing it here.
