# Connections & Relations

Link processes and cards across workflows. **8 MCP tools.**

---

## Key concepts

- **Pipe relations** define parent/child structure between pipes (who connects to whom, constraints, auto-fill). Use `get_pipe_relations` on a pipe to list relation IDs and metadata.
- **Card relations** connect individual cards through an existing pipe relation: pass `source_id` = the pipe relation's ID (from `get_pipe_relations`). Default `sourceType` is `PipeRelation`; use `extra_input` (e.g., `sourceType: Field`) when the API requires a field-based link — see `introspect_type` on `CreateCardRelationInput`.
- **Table relations** in GraphQL are loaded by table-relation ID, not by database table ID: `get_table_relations` takes a non-empty list of those IDs.
- **Connector fields** are card fields (connection type), not pipe relations. Prefer `update_card` + `field_updates` with `operation` ADD/REMOVE (related **card ids**). `update_card_field` is **replace-all** of the full id list; `get_card` `value` is display titles only — do not rebuild from it. This skill's `create_card_relation` / `delete_card_relation` link cards through a pipe relation and are incremental — pick the surface that matches the link type.

## Tools

| Tool (MCP) | CLI | Read-only | Purpose |
|------------|-----|-----------|---------|
| `get_pipe_relations` | `pipefy relation pipe list --pipe <id>` | Yes | List pipe-to-pipe relations for a pipe. |
| `create_pipe_relation` | `pipefy relation pipe create` | No | Create a new pipe-to-pipe relation. |
| `update_pipe_relation` | `pipefy relation pipe update <id>` | No | Change relation config (auto-fill, constraints). |
| `delete_pipe_relation` | `pipefy relation pipe delete <id>` | No | **Two-step destructive.** |
| `get_table_relations` | `pipefy relation table list --ids <id,...>` | Yes | Load table relations by relation ID. |
| `get_card_relations` | `pipefy relation card list --card <id>` | Yes | List all card-to-card relations on a card. |
| `create_card_relation` | `pipefy relation card create` | No | Link two cards through an existing pipe relation. |
| `delete_card_relation` | `pipefy relation card delete <id>` | No | **Two-step destructive.** |

## Steps — link two cards via an existing pipe relation

1. **Get the pipe relation ID:**

   MCP: `get_pipe_relations pipe_id=67890`

   CLI: `pipefy relation pipe list --pipe 67890`

   Note the `id` field on the relation (not the pipe ID).

2. **Create the card relation:**

   MCP: `create_card_relation source_id=<PIPE_RELATION_ID> source_card_id=<PARENT_CARD_ID> target_card_id=<CHILD_CARD_ID>`

   CLI: `pipefy relation card create --source-relation <id> --source-card <id> --target-card <id>`

3. **Verify:**

   MCP: `get_card_relations card_id=<CHILD_CARD_ID>`

---

## Steps — create a new pipe relation

1. **Create the relation between two pipes:**

   MCP: `create_pipe_relation parent_pipe_id=111 child_pipe_id=222 name="Support Escalation" auto_fill_field_id=<field_id>`

   CLI: `pipefy relation pipe create --parent 111 --child 222 --name "Support Escalation"`

2. **Use the relation** — cards in the parent pipe can now be linked to cards in the child pipe using `create_card_relation`.

---

## Success criteria

- `get_pipe_relations` returns the new relation with both pipe IDs.
- `get_card_relations` shows the linked card ID after `create_card_relation`.

## Failure modes

- **`create_card_relation` fails with "relation not found":** `source_id` must be the **pipe relation ID** (from `get_pipe_relations`), not the pipe ID. These are different values.
- **Table relations return empty:** `get_table_relations` requires table-relation IDs, not table IDs. Get table-relation IDs from the table's connection config.
- **`delete_pipe_relation` first call returns preview:** expected — show preview to user, then call with `confirm=true`.
